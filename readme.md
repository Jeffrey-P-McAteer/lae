# Logical Effects Algebra (LAE)

Research into the mathematical rules and operations surrounding "functions"
that look closer to a discrete math / computer science function than
a purely numberic function.

## Goals

 - Explore iteration as a mathematical principle; what laws exist or patterns arise when we combine and evaluate 2+ iteritive functions?
